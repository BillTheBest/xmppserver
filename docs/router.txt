Kontalk XMPP router
========================================

alice@kontalk.net/resource -> alice@prime.kontalk.net/resource
bob@kontalk.net/resource -> bob@fifth.kontalk.net/resource

* JID resolution: from network domain to server domain
* a full JID is unique in the whole network

Using JID resolution we can use a standard XMPP router.
Resolution is done through an external component (resolver).
