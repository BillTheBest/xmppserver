Presence probes ====
If a user replies with multiple <presence/> stanzas (e.g. multiple resources),
find_jid & co. callbacks will not notice that because observer for <presence/>
is removed after a first match. Options:
* wait for the timeout anyway so all stanzas are sent (introduce lags)
* insert some data in <presence/> indicating how many <presence/> stanzas remain
  to be sent (introduce protocol incompatibility)

Presence chain:
<presence from='mercutio@example.com'
          id='xv291f38'
          to='juliet@example.com'
          type='unavailable'>
    <chain xmlns='urn:xmpp:stanza-chain' count='2' />
</presence>

this indicates that other 2 <presence/> stanzas will be pushed after this one.
If timeout is triggered after receiving only a part of all expected <presence/>
stanzas, callback will be fired with the results received so far.
Presence handlers will handle future <presence/> stanzas in the usual manner.
