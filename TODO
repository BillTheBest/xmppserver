== URGENT ==
[ ] client-side acknowledgement
   [x] stanza storage must be accessed by one component only
      [x] sm alerts c2s about local initial presence
   [ ] FIXME in resolver.py/MessageHandler#message

== TODO ==
[ ] JIDCache: cache expiration and invalidation (instead of one big timeout)
[ ] connectionLost: unavailable presence should be sent only if client did not
[ ] delivery receipts (s2s) - this might actually be done using server-receipts

== ALPHA ==
[ ] JIDCache: presence observers (might be used with subscriptions too)
[ ] 2-steps (SMS) registration
[ ] multi-user chat (without using MUC)
[ ] stanza storage should be a component (?)

== COMPLETED ==
[x] c2s resource conflict (sm)
[x] presence storage: remove <group> elements when storing
[x] stanza re-delivery when available presence
[x] refresh lookup only after some time after the last refresh
[x] be careful with MySQL/NOW(): we must always store in UTC!!
[x] JIDCache/resource conflicts: use timestamp to choose most recent result
    (actually there should be none because of initial presence broadcast, but who knows)
