[ ] JIDCache: cache expiration and invalidation
[ ] connectionLost: unavailable presence should be sent only if client did not
[ ] JIDCache: presence observers (might be used with subscriptions too)
[ ] delivery receipts (s2s)
[ ] 2-steps (SMS) registration
[ ] multi-user chat (without using MUC)

== ALPHA ==
[ ] stanza storage should be a component (?)

== COMPLETED ==
[x] c2s resource conflict (sm)
[x] presence storage: remove <group> elements when storing
[x] stanza re-delivery when available presence
[x] refresh lookup only after some time after the last refresh
[x] be careful with MySQL/NOW(): we must always store in UTC!!
[x] JIDCache/resource conflicts: use timestamp to choose most recent result
    (actually there should be none because of initial presence broadcast, but who knows)
